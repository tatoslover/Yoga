      <h4>Start Where You Are</h4>

      <h4>Be Consistent</h4>
      <p>Regular practice, even if brief, is more beneficial than occasional long sessions. Aim for consistency rather than intensity.</p>

    <div class="tip-card">
      <h4>Listen to Your Body</h4>
      <p>Pay attention to how different practices make you feel. Your body will tell you what it needs—sometimes gentle restoration, other times more vigorous movement.</p>

      <h4>Comfortable Clothing</h4>
      <p>Wear clothes that allow free movement without constant adjustment. You want to focus on your practice, not your outfit.</p>
